## Description

This is an application that utilizes Express, mySQL2, and Sequelize to allow the user to connect to and interact with a database consisting of various datatypes. Using GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes created in the application's javascript, the user can successfully access, create, update, and delete data in the database.

## Usage

After the command, 'npm i' is run to install dependencies, the user will be able to seed their database by running 'npm run seed' after they have created a dotenv file containing their MySQL data. The user can then run 'npm start' to start the server and begin testing the API routes for categories, products, and tags in a testing environment such as Insomnia. All data that is displayed will be in JSON format, and thus, all POST and PUT requests are required to be in JSON formatting as well.
